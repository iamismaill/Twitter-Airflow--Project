**Twitter Airflow Project **

In this mini project , I gained hands-on experience in extracting data from Twitter using the Twitter API, and wrote Python scripts to transform and clean the extracted data. Additionally, I created a free trial account on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and installed Apache Airflow on an EC2 instance, allowing me to build and deploy my code as a pipeline. 

This helped me to gain practical knowledge in utilizing Airflow's workflow management capabilities to automate data processing tasks. Finally, I learned how to store data in Amazon S3, a highly scalable and secure cloud storage service, which can be useful in building production-level data pipelines. Overall, this project provided me with a comprehensive understanding of several key data engineering concepts and tools.
